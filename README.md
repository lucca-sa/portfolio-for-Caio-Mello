# Caio Mello's portfolio
</br>
I'm proud to present the portfolio website I crafted for a talented sound engineer. This project was a wonderful opportunity to combine my expertise in HTML and CSS to create a clean, platform that
showcases the engineer's body of work. The design exudes a professional yet inviting atmosphere, allowing visitors to explore the engineer's portfolio with ease.
 It was a pleasure collaborating on this project.
